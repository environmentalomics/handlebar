    <b>Q:</b> Where can I find instructions for using this system? <br />
    <b>A:</b> The slides presented by Tim in Aveiro (April 2012)
              <a href="http://nebc.nerc.ac.uk/handlebar/nbaf_nanofate_portugal_apr2012.pdf">are here.</a>  
	      The main Handlebar user manual (also linked from the main menu above) 
	      <a href="http://nebc.nerc.ac.uk/handlebar/user_guide.pdf">is here.</a>

    <li>
    <b>Q:</b> What should I log into this system? <br />
    <b>A:</b> If you have exposed any organism to any chemical as part of the NanoFATE project then it needs to go in here.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Q:</b> What if I don't actually store any samples? <br />
    <b>A:</b> You still need to enter the samples on the system as if you had stored them, because this database needs a record of all exposures.  In the near future, headline results like LD50 values will be linked to you records in this database.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Q:</b> Do I really need a separate code for each organism? <br />
    <b>A:</b> Only if you are keeping them as individual samples.  If you have, say, 20 daphnea in one a tube collected all at once from one exposure then that is just one sample and therefore barcode.  The guiding principle is one code per Eppendorf (or whatever you store samples in).
    </li>
    <li>

    <b>Q:</b> What if I kept samples of the exposure medium? <br />
    <b>A:</b> You can record these, but the Experiment Creator form does not (yet) support auto-defining them.  You need to allocate the appropriate number of "exposure medium sample" codes from the main interface, then download the spreadsheet and fill it in with the appropriate values.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Q:</b> What if I don't have a uniform number of samples for each dose or timepoint?  How do I stop the system assigning the extra codes for samples that I never took?<br />
    <b>A:</b> Fill in all your doses, timepoints and tissues plus the maximum number of reps, then paste the unused codes from the spreadsheet into the "Mark codes as being disposed" section on the main web interface, with the comment "samples never created".
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Q:</b> How do I record details like confounding factors or other experimental details? <br />
    <b>A:</b> You can add these as comments, but bear in mind that this database is never going to be able to hold a comprehensive
	      description of your experimental set-up; it is just an overview recording the most important factors
	      that the exposure studies have in common.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Q:</b> What if I used a mixture of nanoparticles in an exposure? <br />
    <b>A:</b> You would need to regard this mixture as being a NP batch in itself, and add your particular mixture-batch to the NP batch table.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Q:</b> How do I add or correct things in the drop-down lists? <br />
    <b>A:</b> Use the links on the form, but be sure that you are not changing something you shouldn't.  For example, only
	      Kerstin should ever touch the table of nanoparticle samples.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Q:</b> How do I record actual experimental results? <br />
    <b>A:</b> This is a work in progress...

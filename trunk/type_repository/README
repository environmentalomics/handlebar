Within this directory are exported the type templates that can be loaded into the Handlebar.  

For each template there is an .sql file which can be loaded with psql -f (or equivalent) and a matching .desc
file which contains an HTML description of the type (as created by bcdescribetype).  I've also included some Perl scripts:

showtypes.perl will gather up all the types and compile them into an HTML page
dumptypes.perl will connect to the database specified in barcodes.conf and dump all the types to the
current directory

Also there will be some CGI stuff to pull the repo off SF and to allow someone to submit a type they have exported.

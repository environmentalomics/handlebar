Within this directory are scripts to handle the type templates that can be loaded into the Handlebar.  
The actual types are held in the templates directory at the top level of the SVN tree.

For each template there is an .sql file which can be loaded with psql -f (or equivalent) and a matching .desc
file which contains an HTML description of the type (as created by bcdescribetype).  

The Perl scripts (soem CGI, some standalone):

showtypes.cgi will gather up all the types and compile them into an HTML page
dumptypes.perl will connect to the database specified in barcodes.conf and dump all the types to the
current directory

Also there will be some CGI stuff to pull the repo off SF and to allow someone to submit a type they have exported.

Further notes on showtypes.cgi -

This should really be run off the sf.net web server, since it is closely associated with the SVN repository.  Sadly they don't allow this, so
I'll stick with Envgen.

get list of all the sql files
compile them with a download link and a browse history link
add a form to submit types by asking for the .sql file and mailing it to me

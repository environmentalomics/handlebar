Description: Database and web app for logging uniquely barcoded samples
 This package will install the CGI programs necessary to run the Handlebar 
 system on a Debian/Bio-Linux machine.  If you just want to try the system
 out then use the demo site (http://nebc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/test_barcode/bc).  
 If you want to use an existing barcode database then this package is not for 
 you.  It just has the server-side components which are of no use to users.
 The package can attempt a naive configuration of PostgreSQL in order to work 
 out-of-the-box.  You must have a PostgreSQL server installed prior to 
 installing this package or the setup will fail.  After a successful 
 installation point a browser at http://yourhost/cgi-bin/handlebar/bc.cgi

This file contains some notes on how to install the software on platforms other
than Debian GNU/Linux.

We do not currently have the resources to maintain packages for other platforms
or a generic installation script.  However I would welcome any offers of
packages or improved installation notes if anyone is prepared to offer them.

Instructions for Mac OS-X are in the INSTALL_mac file.

Steps to install:

1) Prerequisites

To run the system for yourself you will need a web server capable of serving
Perl CGI scripts. The recommended system is Debian GNU/Linux with Apache, for
which a .deb package is available from the Bio-Linux package repository, but
the software should run happily on any modern Unix and even Windows (untested)
if installed manually. The software requires a database to store the barcode
definitions and metadata. It has been developed for PostgreSQL 7.3/7.4 and
should also work with 8.x. It will not currently run on other databases such as
MySQL or Oracle.

For non-Debian systems, you will need to make sure you have the following:

    * Perl 5.8
    * A PostgreSQL server (need not be on the same machine as the web server)
    * A working web server with CGI enabled
    * These Perl modules, available from cpan.org:
          o CGI
          o DBD::Pg
          o Text::CSV_XS
          o DBD::AnyData
          o Config::Simple
          o IO::String
          o Mail::Mailer (only needed for the printing module)
          o Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
          o Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
   *  The GenQuery software, also from the NEBC.  This is needed if you want
      to run reports via the web interface (optional).

2) Install web content

Inside the tarball there is a www directory.  Put these files in an appropriate
location to be served by Apache.  The reccommended location is /var/www/handlebar

There is also a cgi-bin directory.  These files need to go in a script-aliased
directory, typically /var/www/cgi-bin/handlebar

The default location where Handlebar looks for its stylesheet and graphics is 
../../handlebar.  You may need to change this in the configuration file - see 4.

3) Setup database

Use the barcodebase.sql file in the share directory to create a database with
the required tables.  Note that this script will create a new user under PostgreSQL,
named www-data, with limited access to the system.

4) Install the templates for GenQuery

The share/genquery folder contains HTML templates used by the GenQuery report maker.
Make a /usr/share/handlebar directory and copy the genquery folder into it.  If you 
use a location other than /usr/share you will need to modify the TEMPLATE_DIR setting in
the configuration file (see next step).

5) Edit your copy of barcodes.conf (in the cgi-bin directory) to match your setup.

See the comments in the file for more details.

6) Try it - point a browser at http://localhost/cgi-bin/handlebar/request_barcodes.cgi

This should be sufficient to get going, but due to the large range of possible configurations I cannot
provide exhaustive instructions, so you may have to apply some cunning.  Good luck!
